<h3>Adding and veriying a new NFT-member in our collection</h3>

Now let us create a memmber that is part of our Nft Collection, i.e, add an item to our collection, and also verify as the collection owner that the new NFT belongs to our collection.

<span style="color: orange;">1.</span>

#### Make a new TS file, e.g 'add-nft-to-collection.ts' inside our previously new-nft folder

In this file, we would copy over some reusable code from our previously created `create-collection.ts` file

```ts
/*
  add-nft-to-collection.ts
*/

import {
	createNft,
	fetchDigitalAsset,
	mplTokenMetadata,
} from '@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata';

import {
	airdropIfRequired,
	getExplorerLink,
	getKeypairFromFile,
} from '@solana-developers/helpers';

import { createUmi } from '@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults';

// web3.js is already installed because it is a dependency of some of the other packages
import { Connection, LAMPORT_PER_SOL, clusterApiUrl } from '@solana/web3.js';

import {
	generateSigner,
	keypairIdentity,
	percentAmount,
	publicKey,
} from '@metaplex-foundation/umi';

const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('devnet'));

// const user
const user = await getKeypairFromFile();

await airdropIfRequired(
	connection,
	user.publicKey,
	1 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
	0.5 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL
);

console.log('Loaded user', user.publicKey.toBase58());

const umi = createUmi(connection.rpcEndpoint); // umi connection to Devnet
umi.use(mplTokenMetadata()); // umi use - run 'mplTokenMetadata' function

const umiUser = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(user.secretKey); // this is just a copy of user, but it is in the format that umi uses for secret keys
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiUser));

console.log('Set-up Umi instance for user');
```

#### Save the address of the colletion for our new NFT, declare new NFT creation into our collection, await NFT creation transaction, and fetch the NFT

We need to save the address for our collection because we are about to use it to make the NFT that belongs to the collection. The address for your collection can be copied from the url link to the collection as shown in the terminal or Solana Explorer link, as in - `https://explorer.solana.com/address/<collection-address-here>`.

```ts
/*
  create-collection.ts
*/

// imports
...

// const connection
...

// const user
const user = await getKeypairFromFile();

// await airdropIfRequired(...);
...

// console.log("Loaded user", user.publicKey.toBase58());
...

const umi = createUmi(connection.rpcEndpoint); // umi connection to Devnet
umi.use(mplTokenMetadata());

const umiUser = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(user.secretKey);// this is just a copy of user, but it is in the format that umi uses for secret keys
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiUser));
console.log("Set-up Umi instance for user");


const collectionAddress = new publicKey("<collection-address-here>");

console.log(`Creating NFT...`);

const mint = generateSigner(umi); // make a keypair (as mint) using umi, because only one NFT can be minted out per mint

const transaction = await createNft(umi, {
	mint,
	name: 'My 1st NFT',
	uri: '<raw-link-to-your-.json-metadata>',
	sellerFeeBasisPoints: percentAmount(0),
    collection: {
        key: collectionAddress,
        verified: false, // we would verify that the NFT is part of our collection later on
    } // provides some information about the collection we want to add the NFT to
});

await transaction.sendAndConfirm(umi);

const createdNft = await fetchDigitalAsset(
    umi,
    mint.publicKey
);

console.log(
    `Created NFT üñºÔ∏è! Address is ${getExplorerLink(
        "address",
        createdNft.mint.publicKey,
        "devnet"
    )}`
);

```

Please note that `<raw-link-to-your-.json-metadata>` of `createNft()`' object argument must be a raw link to a Json file that loads up without extra HTML in-between. In mainnet, you can make use of decentralized storage solutions, e.g, Arweave, or Iris to store your json metadata for permanence instead of github like we did here for demonstrative purposes.

Your `new-nft-metadata.json` file could look like this

```json
{
	"name": "New NFT 1",
	"description": "A first member of the Test Collection 1 series",
	"symbol": "TC1-N1",
	"image": "<raw-link-to-your-new-nft>"
}
```

Just like with our metatdata.json file itself, the image-link value for the image property in it should also be a raw link that loads up an image without extra HTML or anything else surrounding it.

#### Run our 'add-nft-to-collection.ts' script

This guidebook assumes you have `esrun` already installed for this project. Let us run our `our-to-collection.ts` script using command

```bash
npx esrun add-nft-to-collection.ts
```

#### Check out your new collection on Solana Explorer

Upon successfuly running our `add-nft-to-collection.ts` code, it would have added a new NFT to our existing "Test Collection 1", and then provide us a link to it on Solana Explorer right inside the terminal. Follow this link using `Command + click` or `Ctrl + click` to see the new NFT.
