<h2>Solana Blockchain Guide</h2>

This is a book version of [Solana Blockchain Bootcamp 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amAq-WHAFs8) powered by the [Rust](https:///www.rust-lang.org/learn) programming language. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) is another language used throughout the bootcamp, and thus, this guidebook.

You can use it a reference material for Fullstack Solana Development complemented with the official [Solana documentation](https://solana.com/docs) for deeper concepts and know-how.

### Conventions Used

You would find the conventions used in this guidebook both consistent and very intuitive. For explictness reasons, here are the conventions used throught this guidebook.

- Terminal commands come in two variants; block and inline. Inline terminal commands are typed out in between text using the monospace font and trailed by a $ character, for example `$: ls`. Block terminal commands are written on a separate line without any trailing $ symbol.

- Code identifiers such as struct and function names are written using the monospace font, e.g. struct `SetFavorites`. Non-code identifier keywords are also written in monospace font. Sometimes, to avoid code repetition in code snippets, ellipses `...` are used.

- Some pages may contain little tidbit information worthy of remembering that come in a colored caption text that says <span style="color: orange;">Good to know</span>. In this guidebook, you will also find another class of noteworthy information with the caption <span style="color: orange;">Sidenote</span>, which tells you the things you require as you progress through the guidebook.

### Solana Examples

- You can find concrete examples of Solana mini-apps from the official documentation on [Solana Official Docs Page](https://solana.com/docs) for Solana.
