<h3>Swap Program Overview</h3>

Our next smart contract allows users to offer an amount of one token to exchange for a desired amount of another token. For example, Alice wants hundred dog tokens and is offering to swap 10 USDC. Without our program, users would have to swap with each other manually. But what if Bob promised to send Alice a hundred dog tokens but took the 10 USDC and ran? Or what if Alice was dishonest, received the 10 USDC and decided not to send the 100 dog tokens.

In ther traditional finance world, when Alice swapped with Bob, there would usually be someone in the the middle holding the funds temporarily and taking a huge percentage of the transfer for themselves. But in Blockchain, this is sold with a swap program also called and Escrow. Our program will transfer the funds provided by Alice into a vault account and store details of her offer like the amount and type of token she wants. In another PDA, when Bob decides to take the offer, our program will transfer Bob's token to Alice and transfer the funds in the vault to Bob.

Now remember in traditional finance, someone would sit in the middle taking a couple of percentage points of what Alice and Bob are offering. But with our smart contract, Alice got a 100% of the tokens Bob sent. Bob got a 100% of the tokens Alice sent and they both got what they wanted without having to trust each other. Fees were onnly a fraction of a Cent. That is the benefit of Decentralized-Finance.
