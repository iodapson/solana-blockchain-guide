<h3>Verifying a new added NFT to a collection</h3>

<span style="color: orange;">Note:</span> This page/chapter is a direct continuation of the previous 2 pages/chapters that come before this. Hence, it is assumed that you have completed [21. Making an NFT collection](./21.%20Making%20an%20NFT%20Collection.md) and [22. Adding an NFT to a collection](./22.%20Adding%20an%20NFT%20to%20a%20collection.md).

Art tools, particularly wallets or galleries or art marketplaces really like it if you have the `verified` property set to 1. It used to be the case that people would run around and make an NFT that was a fake NFT that looked like it was a member of a real collection. So having verified NFTs is a way for the collection owner to say 'Yes, this NFT is part of my collection'.

#### Make a new TS file, e.g 'verify-nft.ts' inside our previously created 'new-nft' folder

In this file, we would copy over some reusable code from our previously created `add-nft-to-collection.ts` file, and make sure to add new imports needed.

```ts
/*
  add-nft-to-collection.ts
*/

import {
	findMetadataPda,
	mplTokenMetadata,
	verifyCollectionV1,
} from '@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata';

import {
	airdropIfRequired,
	getExplorerLink,
	getKeypairFromFile,
} from '@solana-developers/helpers';

import { createUmi } from '@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults';

// web3.js is already installed because it is a dependency of some of the other packages
import { Connection, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, clusterApiUrl } from '@solana/web3.js';

import {
	generateSigner,
	keypairIdentity,
	percentAmount,
	publicKey,
} from '@metaplex-foundation/umi';

const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('devnet'));

// const user
const user = await getKeypairFromFile();

await airdropIfRequired(
	connection,
	user.publicKey,
	1 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
	0.5 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL
);

console.log('Loaded user', user.publicKey.toBase58());

const umi = createUmi(connection.rpcEndpoint); // umi connection to Devnet
umi.use(mplTokenMetadata()); // umi use - run 'mplTokenMetadata' function

const umiUser = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(user.secretKey); // this is just a copy of user, but it is in the format that umi uses for secret keys
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiUser));

console.log('Set-up Umi instance for user');

const collectionAddress = publicKey('<your-collection-address-here>');
```

<br/>

#### Set up our NFT address

We would now set up the address of the NFT we wish to verify

```ts
/*
  create-collection.ts
*/

// imports
...

// const connection
...

// const user
...

// await airdropIfRequired(...);
...

// console.log("Loaded user", user.publicKey.toBase58());
...

// const umi = createUmi(...); // umi connection to Devnet
...
// umi.use(mplTokenMetadata());
...

// const umiUser = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(...); // this is just a copy of user, but it is in the format that umi uses for secret keys
...
// umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiUser));
...

// console.log('Set-up Umi instance for user');
...

// const collectionAddress = publicKey('<your-collection-address-here>');
...

const nftAddress = publicKey("<your-target-NFT-address-here");
```

<br/>

<span style="color: orange;">3.</span>

#### Make transaction that verifies a NFT is a member of a particular collection and await NFT verification transaction,

This is the transaction that will flip the `verified` metadata property of our NFT in our collection from 0 to 1 (false to true), signaling that the nft is truly part of our collection

```ts
/*
  create-collection.ts
*/

// imports
...

// const connection
...

// const user
...

// await airdropIfRequired(...);
...

// console.log("Loaded user", user.publicKey.toBase58());
...

// const umi = createUmi(...); // umi connection to Devnet
...
// umi.use(mplTokenMetadata());
...

// const umiUser = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(...); // this is just a copy of user, but it is in the format that umi uses for secret keys
...
// umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiUser));
...

// console.log('Set-up Umi instance for user');
...

// const collectionAddress = publicKey('<your-collection-address-here>');

// const nftAddress = publicKey('<your-nft-address-here>')

const transaction = await verifyCollectionV1(umi, {
	metadata: findMetadataPda(umi, { mint: nftAddress }), // the metadata for the NFT we want to verify
	collectionMint: collectionAddress,
	authority: umi.identity // the user running umi.
});

transaction.sendAndConfirm(umi);

console.log(
	`âœ… NFT ${nftAddress} verified as a member of collection ${collectionAddress}! See Explorer at ${getExplorerLink(
		"address",
		nftAddress,
		"devnet"
	)}`
);
```

`authority` could have also been `umiUser` which means the keypair file is the authority, and we would have had to `verifyCollectionV1InstructionAccounts`.

#### Check out your new collection on Solana Explorer

Upon successfuly running our `verify-nft.ts` code, using command `$: npx esrun verify-nft.ts`, it would verify our NFT, and then provide us a link to it on Solana Explorer right inside the terminal. Follow the link using `Command + click` or `Ctrl + click` to see the new NFT.

We can now transfer our verified NFT to people. We can sell it up on aunction sites. We can make Dapps that use this NFT to token-gate access to something that can be a real world experience or a digital experience. It is important that NFTs are verified.

If you want to learn more about Metaplex tools that were used in this lesson, the tool we were using is called MPL token metadata. You can search and find documentation about the tool online.
