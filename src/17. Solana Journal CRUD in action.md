<h3>Quick Journal CRUD Dapp' In Action</h3>

Now that we have both our back-end and front-end for our journal entry cruddapp app done, we would attempt to run it.

<span style="color: orange;">1.</span>

#### First build your crudd-dapp

As usual, we build our Solana project by running `$: anchor build` from inside the `anchor` sub-directory of our project's root directory.

#### Run the Solana CRUD program

In order to run our build Solana program, we need to first navigate into any sub-directory within the root directory of our Solana project (preferably the `src` sub-directory), and then run command `$: npm run dev`. Please note that if your scaffold was generated with the `Nix` tooling, you probably would have to navigate inside the `web` sub-directory before running the command earlier stated. This book assumes that you use NPM to generated your project scaffold.

#### Open your app at localhost:3000

Open up your favorite browser app and visit `localhost:3000`.

You need to do a few things:

- Click on `Clusters` (should be located at the top left-side of the screen on PC or Mac), and connect to `local` cluster by clicking on the `local` cluster link on display.

- Optionally request an airdrop to ensure that you have funds on your local cluster.

- Click on `Cruddapp Program` (should be located at the top left-side of the screen on PC or Mac). If you see a prompt on the screen that say `program account not found. Make sure you have deployed the program and are on the correct cluster."`, then it means that you have navigate into your `anchor` sub-directory, then rebuild your project using command `$: anchor build`, then enter command `$: anchor keys sync`, then enter command `$: anchor deploy --provider.cluster localnet`. If the prompt still persists then follow this next step.

- This step is for you if you are still receiving the prompt `program account not found. Make sure you have deployed the program and are on the correct cluster.` after you have tried the steps stated above. Alright, so to fix this issue, navigate to your `anchor/src/cruddapp-exports.ts` file and check to make sure that the exported function `getCruddappProgramId()` returns the correct PublicKey in its `testnet` case. The correct PublicKey is one that is the same as the PublicKey provided in `anchor/programs/src/lib.rs`' `declare_id!()`. Now rerun your Solana crudd-dapp as done earlier above [here](#run-the-solana-crud-program).

- In case you are have the issue whereby you receive a prompt that says `program account not found. Make sure you have deployed the program and are on the correct cluster.` and the previous step hasn't fixed it, go back to your browser window where your crudd-dapp is currently running, selct the `Cruddapp Program` tab, click on the referenced key link you see at the center of the screen, then copy the `Address` you see on the Solana Explorer page that the link directs you to. Now, perform a project-wide search of the copied `Address` for your project inside your IDE (possibly VS Code), and replace all matching finds with the correct address. The correct address is the one found inside `anchor/programs/src/lib.rs`' `declare_id!()`. Don't forget to save the code changes.

- Now we can give our Journal Entry Crudd-dapp a spin by performing CRUD operations on it!
