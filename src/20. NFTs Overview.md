<h3>What are NFTs</h3>

NFTs are just SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens, exactly like we made in the previous section about Tokens, so if you already walked throught the previous section about Tokens, then you already know most of what you need to make an NFT.

Just like other tokens, they are minted from token-mint accounts and stored in associated-token-accounts and transfered with the token program. However, NFTs have a few characteristics that are distinct.

- Firstly, they are unique, i.e, each NFT only has one ever minted.

- Also, they cannot be broken up. In other words, each NFT has zero decimal places.

- Additionally, the metadata for an NFT contains links to another file stored on a file storage service like Iris, or IPFS. This off-chain metadata file has links to media files like images, videos, or 3D objects, any traits the NFT has, links to the project that made the NFT and more.

- Authencity is also handled differently with NFTs. With regular tokens like USDC, we know they are authentic because their mint address matches the official USDC mint address, but since each NFT has a unique mint address, we use the concept of collections to verify that each NFT is actually minted by the right project and not a forgery on person created.

Now let's go make an NFT.
