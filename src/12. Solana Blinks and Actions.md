<h3>Solana Actions & Blinks</h3>

In this project 3, we are going to bring the previous voting application (`votingdapp`) to people's favorite websites using Solana `Actions` and `Blinks`.

#### What is a Solana Action

Solana `Actions` are a specification for an API that can return a transaction on Solana to be previewed, sign, and sent. Whether it is a button, website or QR code, actions make it simple for developers to integrate the things you can do throughout the Solana ecosystem right into your environment.

#### What is a Solana Blink

Solana `Blinks` are blockchain links. They turn any action into a shareable link, allowing any website that supports links to be the starting point of a Solana transaction. As a result, blinks transform websites or social media into a platform for executing transactions all without taking the user elsewhere.

Any website could be the surface for you rnew application, creating both a decentralized and user-friendly experience.

In practice, Actions resemble a typical REST API call. A user interacting with a website would trigger a get call to retrieve information about what actions are available. Following the list of available actions, the user can then choose an Action to execute, which will then start the transaction signing process.

We will be making all our votes in our previous application be actions, allowing them to be executed without a traditional front-end with the help of blinks (as the front-end).

Now that we've had an overview of Blinks and Actions, let's get started building them.
